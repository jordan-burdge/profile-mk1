      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    <h5> Favorite Vacation Spot Cannon Beach, Oregon</h5>
    <h8>The beach is my favorite place to relax with my family. We like collecting sand dollars, and sea shells early in the morning before most people are awake when it is nice and quiet. We like to visit filming sites for the movie "The Goonies" in nearby Astoria. One fun thing is to go crabbing and have a crab boil with our catch.</h8>
